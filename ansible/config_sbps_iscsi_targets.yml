# Personalize/ configure identified worker nodes for iSCSI SBPS (Scalable Boot
# Content Projection Service):
#   - provision these worker nodes as iSCSI targets with LIO services
#   - install/ enable SBPS Marshal Agent(systemd service) on these iSCSI targets
#   - create DNS SRV and A records to be used to discover iSCSI targets during compute nodes booting
#   - mount s3 bucket (boot-image) images using new dedicated s3 read only policy
#   - apply k8s label to the personalized nodes for other consumers of iSCSI SBPS
# 
# By default all the worker nodes (Management_Worker) will be configured OR 
# admin/ user can chose to configure only subset of worker nodes defined in 
# CFS config/ HSM group during personalization.

# Personalize/ configure identified worker nodes for iSCSI SBPS (Scalable Boot
# Content Projection Service):
#   - provision these worker nodes as iSCSI targets with LIO services
#   - install/ enable SBPS Marshal Agent(systemd service) on these iSCSI targets
#   - create DNS SRV and A records to be used to discover iSCSI targets during compute nodes booting
#   - mount s3 bucket (boot-image) images using new dedicated s3 read only policy
#   - apply k8s label to the personalized nodes for other consumers of iSCSI SBPS
# 
# All the worker nodes (Management_Worker) will be configured.
# By default, all of the worker nodes will have the Kubernetes iscsi label applied, and will
# be included in the DNS record updates. This is the case unless
# the HSM group defined below (under iscsi_group_name) exists. If that HSM group exists,
# then:
# 1. All worker nodes belonging to that group will have the Kubernetes iscsi label applied, and will
#    be included in the DNS record updates.
# 2. All worker nodes NOT belonging to that group will have the Kubernetes iscsi label removed, and
#    it will not be included in the DNS record updates. However, if it was included on a previous
#    run of this playbook, then removal of the DNS records must be done manually by the administrator.

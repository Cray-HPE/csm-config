# csm-config

## Build Helpers
This repo uses some build helper scripts from the 
[cms-meta-tools](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/cms-meta-tools) repo. See that repo for more details.

## Local Builds
If you wish to perform a local build, you will first need to clone or copy the contents of the
cms-meta-tools repo to `./cms_meta_tools` in the same directory as the `Makefile`.

## Versioning
Use [SemVer](http://semver.org/). The version is located in the [.version](.version) file. At
build time, [Jenkinsfile.github](Jenkinsfile.github) generates the Docker version and Chart version
strings, and writes those to .docker_version and .chart_version respectively.

## Copyright and License

license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

When making any modifications to a file that has a Cray/HPE copyright header, that header
must be updated to include the current year.

When creating any new files in this repo, if they contain source code, they must have
the HPE copyright and license text in their header, unless the file is covered under
someone else's copyright/license (in which case that should be in the header). For this
purpose, source code files include Dockerfiles, Ansible files, RPM spec files, and shell
scripts. It does **not** include Jenkinsfiles, OpenAPI/Swagger specs, or READMEs.

When in doubt, provided the file is not covered under someone else's copyright or license, then
it does not hurt to add ours to the header.

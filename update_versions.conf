#tag: version tag string to be replaced (optional -- if unspecified @VERSION@ is assumed)
#sourcefile: file to obtain the actual version from (optional -- if unspecified, .version is assumed)
#            If this file is executable, it will be executed and the output will be used as the version string.
#            Otherwise it will be read and its contents will be used as the version string. The string is checked
#            to verify it is valid semver (see update_versions.sh header for details)
#
#sourcefile_nosemver: Same as sourcefile except that the string it contains is not checked to make sure
#                     it is valid semver. Instead, it simplify must consist of legal characters:
#                     a-z A-Z 0-9 . , - _ : ; = + / (space) & @ ! $ % * ( ) | { } [ ] < > ? #
#

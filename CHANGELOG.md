## [Unreleased]

## [1.48.2] - 2025-08-20

### Changed

- CASMPET-7660: Changes to `sbps_dns_srv_records.sh` in `csm.sbps.dns_srv_records`
  - Fail if `SYSTEM_NAME` or `SITE_DOMAIN` are not set
  - Added echo statements role, to make it easier to debug in case of failure
  - Remove `-s` and `-f` flags from `curl` calls, and add `-i` flag, so they will
    give error messages and information on failure.

## [1.48.1] - 2025-08-19

### Fixed

- CASMTRIAGE-8638: RR k8s zone prefix is not getting applied correctly
  - Fixed `csm.rr.k8s_topology_zoning` role to use correct YAML path.

## [1.48.0] - 2025-08-15

### Fixed

- CASM-5685: RR storage play still assumes kubectl configured on all storage nodes
  - Fixed csm.rr.mgmt_nodes_placement_discovery role to use native Ansible (for kubectl) inside the
    CFS pod to get the information from Kubernetes instead of getting it from the node directly.
## [1.47.0] - 2025-08-14

### Changed

- CASM-5681:
  - Modify `csm.rr.check_enablement` role to set `ceph_prefix` fact from `customizations.yaml`,
    for use by other roles
  - Modify `csm.rr.ceph_zoning` to use the `ceph_prefix` fact
  - Modify `csm.rr.ceph_zoning` to run Ceph zoning and haproxy tasks only once. If already run, skip these roles. 

### Removed

- CASM-5676 (RR needlessly restarts deployments), 
  CASM-5677 (RR always overwrites Kyverno policy),
  CASM-5678 (RR restarts wrong deployments):
    - Remove `csm.rr.kyverno_policy` role from `csm-config`

### Dependencies

- Bump `actions/checkout` from 4 to 5 ([#402](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/csm-config/pull/402))

## [1.46.1] - 2025-08-12

### Fixed

- CASMCMS-9512: Modify the `csm.ssh_config` and `csm.ssh_keys` roles so that they no longer
  call `end_play` when they are only actually wanting to end the role.

## [1.46.0] - 2025-08-01

### Changed

- CASM-5672: Run placement validation in storage stanza, to prevent storage configuration when placement validation fails
- CASM-8567: Moved `csm.rr.ceph_zoning` Ansible role from management node flow to storage-specific section to better align with Ceph-specific operations.
- CASM-5671: Modify `csm.rr.check_enablement` role
  - Rather than assuming that RR is enabled unless it is explicitly set to disabled,
    instead assume that it is disabled unless it is explicitly set to enabled
  - Re-implement Python script in native Ansible
  - Modify so it runs inside the CFS pod
  - Save the result as an Ansible fact so that if both plays in the playbook run,
    this only needs to be done once.

### Fixed

- CASM-8567: Corrected typo in Kubernetes rollout restart command: `deploymet` â†’ `deployment` for `cray-ceph-csi-cephfs-provisioner`.

## [1.45.0] - 2025-07-23

### Changed

- CASM-5661: RR Ansible play only checks for RR enablement sometimes
- CASM-5660: Changed to skip enabling/ configuring Rack Resiliency instead of failing 
  the configuration when it is disabled in the site-init (customizations.yaml) config.

## [1.44.0] - 2025-07-22

### Added

- CASM-5656
  - Added new role `csm.rr.ceph_haproxy` for CEPH haproxy config update
  - Tasks related to CEPH haproxy are moved from `csm.rr.ceph_zoning` to above new role
  - playbook `rack_resiliency_for_mgmt_nodes.yml` is update accordingly with above changes

### Fixed

- CASM-5656
  - Fixed typo in `ceph_haproxy.sh` of role `csm.rr.ceph_haproxy`

## [1.43.0] - 2025-07-17

### Added

- CASM-5626: Added new tasks for CEPH haproxy config update in `main.yml` for role `csm.rr.ceph_zoning`

### Changed

- CASM-5626
  - Changed the hosts for RR CEPH ansible play books in `rack_resiliency_for_mgmt_nodes.yml`
  - Updated logic in scripts `ceph_zoning.py` and `ceph_haproxy.sh`

## [1.42.1] - 2025-07-15

### Changed
- CASMPET-7624: Add check to beginning of `csm.sbps.apply_label`, to make sure that if the HSM iSCSI
  group exists, that it contains at least one worker NCN. If it does not, fail the playbook for all hosts
  with an appropriate error message.
- CASMPET-7625: Modified apply_label role to run only once, and inside the CFS pod, since nothing it does requires
  the target nodes to be up and running. This will allow node labels to be updated for every worker, whether or not they
  are up at the time the playbook is run.

## [1.42.0] - 2025-07-10

### Changed

- CASMPET-7616: Modify iSCSI playbook to be aware of new HSM group
  - The playbook runs on all worker nodes, and does the iSCSI configuration on all of them.
  - The `csm.sbps.apply_label` role behavior has changed. Now all workers in the group will have the
    label applied to them, and all workers not in the group will have the label removed from them.
  - The `csm.sbps.dns_srv_records` role previously queried SLS and made DNS entries for all worker
    nodes. Now it instead does this for all worker nodes that have the iSCSI Kubernetes label.
  - For the purposes of these changes, if the new HSM group does not exist, it is the same as if it
    exists and all workers belong to it.

## [1.41.0] - 2025-06-25

### Changed

- CASMTRIAGE-8171
  - Changed the order of iSCSI ansible play books execution in `config_sbps_iscsi_targets.yml`

## [1.34.0] - 2025-05-27

### Added

  - Added `csm.ssh_config` roles to restore user SSH configuration from Vault
  - Added calls to this role to top-level NCN playbooks that called `csm.ssh_keys`
  - Created new top-level playbook `rotate-ssh-config-mgmt-nodes.yml`, akin to `rotate-ssh-keys-mgmt-nodes.yml`

## [1.26.0] - 2024-09-12

- Replace all `ansible_os_family` and `ansible_distribution` conditionals for `SLE_HPC` with `ansible_distribution_file_variety == "SUSE"` to be
  agnostic to the SUSE product line (enabling usage on GCP images in `vshastav1` and `vshastav-future` once we move to hypervisors)

## [1.16.12] - 2023-08-03

### Added

- CASMTRIAGE-5788

### Changed

- MTL-2000/CASMINST-3431: Modify [`csm_repos.yml`](ansible/vars/csm_repos.yml) so that instead of adding Zypper repos for
  every SLE version, it only adds the Zypper repository for the SLE version where the play is being run; the `csm-noos`
  repo is always still added.

## [1.16.8] - 2023-07-06

### Changed

- CASMINST-6535
  - Reorganize the plays in [`ncn_nodes.yml`](ansible/ncn_nodes.yml) to take advantage of Ansible package install optimizations.

  master/worker NCNs), and `compute_csm_sles_packages` (installed on all SLES application and compute nodes).
  Modified the plays accordingly.
- CASMINST-6532: Added some RPMs that were missing from the NCN list:
  - `cfs-state-reporter`
  - `cfs-trust`
  - `craycli`
  - `csm-auth-utils`

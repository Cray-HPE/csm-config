# csm-config Helm chart

In most cases the resources here should be left at their defaults. Should you need to add additional resources to your helm chart, you have the ability to do so. If you find that you're making changes that might be applicable to other Cray services, you're encouraged to submit a pull request to [the base service chart](https://github.com/Cray-HPE/base-charts/blob/master/kubernetes/cray-service).
